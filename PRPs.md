# WireGuard SD-WAN Project Requirements Document (INITIAL)

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a WireGuard-based SD-WAN solution implementing a hub-and-spoke topology for enterprise network connectivity. The solution provides centralized management, automated configuration, and high availability for distributed VPN networks.

## Core Architecture

### Topology Model
- **Hub-and-Spoke**: Central hub nodes route traffic between spoke nodes
- **Multi-Hub Support**: Multiple hub nodes for redundancy and load distribution
- **Centralized Control**: SDN-style control plane for unified management

### Key Components
1. **Controller/Orchestrator**: Central control plane service
2. **Node Agents**: Lightweight daemons on spoke nodes
3. **Web UI**: Management interface for administrators
4. **API Gateway**: RESTful API for automation and integration
5. **Database**: Persistent storage for configuration and topology data

## Technical Requirements

### Performance & Scalability
- Support 1000+ VPN nodes
- Automated WireGuard configuration generation
- Real-time topology updates and monitoring
- High-throughput packet forwarding

### Security
- WireGuard's modern cryptography (ChaCha20, Poly1305)
- Public/private key pair authentication
- Optional pre-shared key (PSK) support
- Private keys remain local to nodes
- HTTPS/TLS for control plane communication

### High Availability
- Multi-zone hub deployment
- Load balancer for hub failover
- Database replication and backup
- Automatic failover mechanisms

## Functional Requirements

### Node Management
- Automatic node registration/deregistration
- Dynamic IP address allocation
- Key pair generation and management
- Configuration synchronization

### Access Control
- ACL rules for inter-node communication
- Network segmentation policies
- Group-based access management
- Traffic filtering capabilities

### Monitoring & Logging
- Real-time connection status monitoring
- Traffic statistics (Rx/Tx bytes)
- System health monitoring
- Centralized logging and alerting

### Configuration Management
- Automatic config distribution to nodes
- Version control for configurations
- Rollback capabilities
- Bulk operations support

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Go (for performance and concurrency)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with replication
- **Message Queue**: Redis for real-time updates
- **Metrics**: Prometheus for monitoring

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Ant Design
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Visualization**: D3.js for topology graphs

### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes support
- **Environment**: Ubuntu Linux (20.04+)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
