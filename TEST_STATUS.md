## 🏃‍♂️ Test Execution

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- PostgreSQL (for integration tests)
- SQLite (for unit tests)

### Running Tests

#### Using Test Runner
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go run tests/test_runner.go -type=all -v -coverage

# Run specific test types
go run tests/test_runner.go -type=unit -v
go run tests/test_runner.go -type=integration -v
go run tests/test_runner.go -type=functional -v
```

#### Using Shell Script
```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/run_tests.sh all

# Run with coverage
./tests/run_tests.sh all true true

# Run specific test types
./tests/run_tests.sh unit
./tests/run_tests.sh integration
./tests/run_tests.sh functional
```

#### Using Makefile
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run unit tests only
make test-unit

# Run integration tests only
make test-integration
```
